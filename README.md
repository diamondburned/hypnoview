Hypnoview provides a frontend for the [Hypnohub](https://hypnohub.net) image
board. Currently, it provides Go libraries for interacting with the Hypnohub
API, as well as several smaller frontend utilities.

The actual frontend is a work in progress, and is not yet available.

I'm currently hosting the [Popular Query app](./cmd/popular-query-app) on
[popularhypnohub.diamondx.pet](https://popularhypnohub.diamondx.pet). This
app provides a way to get the most popular posts on Hypnohub, which is a feature
that was removed from the site.
